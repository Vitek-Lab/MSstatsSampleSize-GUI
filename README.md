# MSstats Sample Size Calculator
MSstats - Sample Size Calculator is a web-based graphical user interface that provides a user-friendly way to visualize and report the results from MSstatsSampleSize package

MSstatsSampleSize is an open-source R package, available in Bioconductor. It allows researchers to design optimal MS-based proteomics experiments in terms of statistical power and the use of resources. In particular, MSstatsSampleSize uses protein-level data from a prior MS-based proteome investigation as a basis to plan future experiments with similar methodologies. The software therefore significantly contributes to the design of biological and clinical studies that involve replicates.

MSstats - Sample Size Estimator was created using R-Shiny , a Web Application Framework for R. It enables researchers without experience with R/programming to utilize the functions from MSstatsSampleSize.
