<h1>Additional Tuning</h1>

This is currently under testing and not completely implemented, use at own
risk

*use h2o* parameter enables the use of h2o based classification algorithms
these will show faster run times for larger datasets only limited by the
available RAM and CPU, 4GB of RAM recommended.

*parameter tuning* enables to customize the parameters used for model training
